## Graph Layout Java Swing Component

# Description

XXX is a Java Swing Component aimed at displaying general graphs (e.g. nodes connected to each others). Its design objectives are to make it easy to use, extend and useful in the context of experimenting with graph layout algorithms. It is developped at the Cnrs / I3S Compouter Science lab / Université Côte d'Azur / Inria. 

# Features
- Written in Java
- Swing component
- OO model
- no intrusive: you can add any (of your) objects in the graph
